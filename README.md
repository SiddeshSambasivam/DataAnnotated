DataAnnotated is a platform which offers various data annotation task with easy collaboration with peers. The platform creates a seamless integration between data in annotation and data used in development. This way the developer can keep track of the annotated data while in development with no need for manually checking the annotated data every once in a while.

A complimentary python package is developed connecting their user profile during development. In this way, they could annotate their data and download it from the package during development.
